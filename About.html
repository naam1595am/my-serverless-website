              <h2>Hello! <br> My name is <span>Nick Anaya</span> and...</h2>
              <p>
                I am a fourth-year student at Texas A&M University, where I am working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Awarded the NACME scholarship for academic excellence and leadership potential, I have benefitted from both significant financial support and professional growth opportunities offered through developmental seminars.
                <br><br>
                My academic pursuits and interests include software engineering, full-stack development, and artificial intelligence. My passion for uniting the creativity of art with the logic of science drives my ambition to develop innovative and user-friendly technological solutions.
                <br><br>
                I have worked as an intern at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in summer 2023 and contributed to web development and game design projects as a freelancer since 2016. Looking to the future, I intend to embrace a full-time role as a software engineer while continuing to engage in personal projects that enhance my abilities.
