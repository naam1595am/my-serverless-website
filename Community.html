                    I'm an officer in the Academic Outreach deparment of AHIC.
                    AHIC (Aggie Hispanics in Computing) is a Texas A&M University organization that is built on a community of university students who want to explore their interest in the field of technology 
                    and empowering Latinx/Hispanics students to succeed in careers in computing. AHIC embraces the mission and goals of Hispanics in Computing.

                    I was recipient of the Richard Tapia 2022 Conference scholarship and I had the opportunity to represent Texas A&M University at the conference in Washington D.C. 
                    I volunteered for a total of 12 hours and attended many of the talks where I learned many things about technology, inclusion and career paths.

                    I was part of the first class of the Texas A&M Chevron Academy at Houston Community College. This opportunity opened the door for me to attend my dream school and get into my major.
                    I met wonderful people and was part of many events that helped me get into the Aggie spirit and easily transition from a community college to a four year university.

                    I participated and won second place at the 2015 Houston Community College Global Talent Show, which got me a spot to sing in the Houston Community College Global Luncheon. 
                    At the event, I was able to perform a Peruvian-folk song in front of embassadors of many countries.
