            <h2> Hello! <br> My name is <span> Nick Anaya </span> and... </h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University. I was born and raised in Peru, and then one day when I was 14 years old I moved to Houston, TX. I travel back and forth all the time so I feel like both places are home. 
                <br> A fun fact about me is that growing up I wanted to be all of these things in order: </br> A fine art painter, a chef, a president, a singer, an architect, a film director and finally (and hopefully stays like that this time) a software engineer. I chose my major because it gives me the freedom to do whatever I want: I can make games or websites, do research on biological physics, or build a computer, make apps or work on prediction models that use A.I. 
                <br> Some other fun facts about me that you might not care about but Iâ€™ll make you read anyways are: </br>
                I love to sing, I love to read books of all kinds and write stories, I love to play video games, 
                <br> and the most important thing: I love to just exist and experience life. </br>
