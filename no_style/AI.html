		<h1>Nick Meets God</h1>
		<p>Nick was a young computer scientist who always had a curious mind. One day, he found himself in front of God. He was nervous but also excited to ask the questions that he always wanted answers to.</p>
		<p>Nick asked God, "What is the meaning of life?" God replied, "The meaning of life is to find happiness and to spread it to others."</p>
		<p>Nick then asked, "What is the purpose of suffering?" God replied, "Suffering is a part of life, it helps you grow and become a better person. It is a test of your strength and a chance to show compassion to others."</p>
		<p>Nick's last question was, "What happens after we die?" God replied, "After you die, your soul returns to the universe and continues to exist in a different form."</p>
		<p>Nick was sad after hearing the answers to his questions, but he felt a sense of hope and understanding. He realized that his purpose in life was to make a positive impact on others and to find happiness. He also learned that suffering is a part of life and that it is important to embrace it and learn from it.</p>
